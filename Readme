# Ardün – Regenerating Life in Indiana

**"Heal the soil. Grow the future. Support the people."**

Ardün is a volunteer-powered project that rebuilds healthy soil, restores ecosystems, and grows resilient communities through regenerative greenhouses, shared harvests, and open-source knowledge.

## 📍  Where We Work
Indiana – greenhouse living labs that double as classrooms and donation hubs.

## 🌱  What We Do
- **Regenerate soil** with prehistoric-atmosphere simulations  
- **Share half** of every harvest with local families & food pantries  
- **Teach** volunteers soil science, logistics, and sustainable growing  
- **Document everything** so the model can spread across the Midwest
